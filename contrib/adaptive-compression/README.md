ZSTD_adapt is a compression tool targeted at optimizing performance across network connections. The tool aims at sensing network speeds and adapting compression level based on network or pipe speeds.
In many scenarios, using ZSTD without a properly adjusted compression level results in a pipe bottleneck, or a compressed file that could have been reduced in size.
