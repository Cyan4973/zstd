*  Seekable Format
*
*  The seekable format splits the compressed data into a series of "frames",
*  each compressed individually so that decompression of a section in the
*  middle of an archive only requires zstd to decompress at most a frame's
*  worth of extra data, instead of the entire archive.

*  Seekable compression - HowTo
*  A ZSTD_seekable_CStream object is required to tracking streaming operation.
*  Use ZSTD_seekable_createCStream() and ZSTD_seekable_freeCStream() to create/
*  release resources.
*
*  Streaming objects are reusable to avoid allocation and deallocation,
*  to start a new compression operation call ZSTD_seekable_initCStream() on the
*  compressor.
*
*  Data streamed to the seekable compressor will automatically be split into
*  frames of size `maxFrameSize` (provided in ZSTD_seekable_initCStream()),
*  or if none is provided, will be cut off whenever ZSTD_seekable_endFrame() is
*  called or when the default maximum frame size (2GB) is reached.
*
*  Use ZSTD_seekable_initCStream() to initialize a ZSTD_seekable_CStream object
*  for a new compression operation.
*  `maxFrameSize` indicates the size at which to automatically start a new
*  seekable frame.  `maxFrameSize == 0` implies the default maximum size.
*  `checksumFlag` indicates whether or not the seek table should include frame
*  checksums on the uncompressed data for verification.
*  @return : a size hint for input to provide for compression, or an error code
*            checkable with ZSTD_isError()
*
*  Use ZSTD_seekable_compressStream() repetitively to consume input stream.
*  The function will automatically update both `pos` fields.
*  Note that it may not consume the entire input, in which case `pos < size`,
*  and it's up to the caller to present again remaining data.
*  @return : a size hint, preferred nb of bytes to use as input for next
*            function call or an error code, which can be tested using
*            ZSTD_isError().
*            Note 1 : it's just a hint, to help latency a little, any other
*                     value will work fine.
*
*  At any time, call ZSTD_seekable_endFrame() to end the current frame and
*  start a new one.
*
*  ZSTD_seekable_endStream() will end the current frame, and then write the seek
*  table so that decompressors can efficiently find compressed frames.
*  ZSTD_seekable_endStream() may return a number > 0 if it was unable to flush
*  all the necessary data to `output`.  In this case, it should be called again
*  until all remaining data is flushed out and 0 is returned.
