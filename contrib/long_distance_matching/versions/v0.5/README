This version uses simple lz4-style compression with a rolling hash.
- A rolling checksum based on rsync's Adler-32 style checksum is used.
- The checksum is hashed using lz4's hash function.
- Hash table replacement policy: direct overwrite.
- The length of input to the hash function can be set with LDM_HASH_LENGTH.
