/**
 *  Compresses src into dst.

 *
 *  Block format (see lz4 documentation for more information):
 *  github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Block_format.md
 *
 *  A block is composed of sequences. Each sequence begins with a token, which
 *  is a one-byte value separated into two 4-bit fields.
 *
 *  The first field uses the four high bits of the token and encodes the literal
 *  length. If the field value is 0, there is no literal. If it is 15,
 *  additional bytes are added (each ranging from 0 to 255) to the previous
 *  value to produce a total length.
 *
 *  Following the token and optional length bytes are the literals.
 *
 *  Next are the 4 bytes representing the offset of the match (2 in lz4),
 *  representing the position to copy the literals.
 *
 *  The lower four bits of the token encode the match length. With additional
 *  bytes added similarly to the additional literal length bytes after the offset.
 *
 *  The last sequence is incomplete and stops right after the lieterals.
