/**
 * Zstd fits all its internal datastructures into a single continuous buffer,
 * so that it only needs to perform a single OS allocation (or so that a buffer
 * can be provided to it and it can perform no allocations at all). This buffer
 * is called the workspace.
 *
 * Several optimizations complicate that process of allocating memory ranges
 * from this workspace for each datastructure:
 *
 * - These different internal datastructures have different setup requirements.
 *   Some (e.g., the window buffer) don't care, and are happy to accept
 *   uninitialized memory. Others (e.g., the matchstate tables) can accept
 *   memory filled with unknown but bounded values (i.e., a memory area whose 
 *   values are known to be constrained between 0 and some upper bound). If
 *   that constraint isn't known to be satisfied, the area has to be cleared.
 *
 * - We would like to reuse the objects in the workspace for multiple
 *   compressions without having to perform any expensive reallocation or
 *   reinitialization work.
 *
 * - We would like to be able to efficiently reuse the workspace across
 *   multiple compressions **even when the compression parameters change** and
 *   we need to resize some of the objects (where possible).
 *
 * Workspace Layout:
 *
 * [                        ... workspace ...                         ]
 * [objects][tables ... ->] free space [<- ... aligned][<- ... buffers]
 *
 * In order to accomplish this, the various objects that live in the workspace
 * are divided into the following categories:
 *
 * - Static objects: this is optionally the enclosing ZSTD_CCtx or ZSTD_CDict,
 *   so that literally everything fits in a single buffer. Note: if present,
 *   this must be the first object in the workspace, since ZSTD_free{CCtx,
 *   CDict}() rely on a pointer comparison to see whether one or two frees are
 *   required.
 *
 * - Fixed size objects: these are fixed-size, fixed-count objects that are
 *   nonetheless "dynamically" allocated in the workspace so that we can
 *   control how they're initialized separately from the broader ZSTD_CCtx.
 *   Examples:
 *   - Entropy Workspace
 *   - 2 x ZSTD_compressedBlockState_t
 *   - CDict dictionary contents
 *
 * - Tables: these are any of several different datastructures (hash tables,
 *   chain tables, binary trees) that all respect a common format: they are
 *   uint32_t arrays, all of whose values are between 0 and (nextSrc - base).
 *   Their sizes depend on the cparams.
 *
 * - Aligned: these buffers are used for various purposes that don't require
 *   any initialization before they're used.
 *
 * - Uninitialized memory: these buffers are used for various purposes that
 *   don't require any initialization before they're used. This means they can
 *   be moved around at no cost for a new compression.
 *
 * Allocating Memory:
 *
 * The various types of objects must be allocated in order, so they can be
 * correctly packed into the workspace buffer. That order is:
 *
 * 1. Objects
 * 2. Buffers
 * 3. Aligned
 * 4. Tables
 *
 * Reusing Table Space:
 *
 * TODO(felixh): ...
